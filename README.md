# Calorymita
A fun project to learn/use Cockroach DB, Linode, CircleCI and Github for Revolution UC 2022 hackathon. Built by Salisu Ali, a 500 level Medical Student of Bayero University Kano, Nigeria. I have Passion for technology and want to explore new things.

## Technologies Used
 - Calorymita was written using nodejs, express and CockroachDB 
 - **Cockroach DB** : Successfully create TABLE but unable to write the necessary code to Insert data into TABLE. TABLE schema was defined in ```dbinit.sql``` and nested in a bash script file named ```db.sh```. child process was used to run the bash shell file to create the table. connection string parameters are stored in clmita.json under config directory. I learnt something new here
 - **Linode** : I was able to create a linode VM with linux image. I was able to install and run nodejs, cockroachDB and calorymita on the server. Linode is new to me. linode VM IP adress 139.177.200.181
 - **Github** : Github was my Source Code Manager. i'm familiar with it.
 - **CircleCI** : I failed, but not given up.


### A big Thank You to Revolution UC and Partners for Organizing this hackathon
